                <h1 class="headings">FOOTBALLer</h1>
                Football to me isn't just about the game on the field. It's teamwork,
                 it's persevering through pain and setbacks, it's showing sportsmanship whether you win or you lose,
                  and it's never ever giving up
                  <br> <br> 
                  Team sports like football is teaching me important life skills such as teamwork, communication, leadership, and time management.
                 As players collaborate to achieve a common goal, they learn to value individual strengths
                    while acknowledging the significance of collective effort.
                    <br> <br> 
                    I personally like football because first things first am a short guy so that's that and i find that most skillful players 
                    are short and i am very active when it comes to just sports, football is a overall sport i can play well without thinking what 
                    my next move will be and i feel free when playing.

                Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating images by recording light,
                 either electronically by means of an image sensor, 
                 or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film.
                 <br> <br> 
                 I love taking pictures of things that interests me the most and making videos of me playing football 
                 with my friends, places that i visited either where i was, was fun and a new experience or just down right bad vibes

                Gaming is really a workout for your mind disguised as fun.
                 Studies have shown that playing video games regularly may increase gray matter in the brain and boost brain connectivity. 
                 (Gray matter is associated with muscle control, memories, perception, and spatial navigation.)
                 <br> <br>
                 I enjoy playing games like FIFA it is a sport football game and uncharted its a adventure game that deals with solving puzzle and unaliving enemies.
                 Horizon Zero Dawn is the first game of the Horizon video game series. The plot follows Aloy, a young hunter in a world overrun by machines,
                  who sets out to uncover her past. The player uses ranged weapons, a spear, and stealth to combat mechanical creatures and other enemy forces
